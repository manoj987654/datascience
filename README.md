## 🧠 Key Projects

### 1. 🗣️ Sentiment Analysis  
A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that analyzes user-generated text (e.g., reviews or tweets) to classify sentiments as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, NLTK/TextBlob, Scikit-learn  
- **Approach:** Text preprocessing, vectorization (TF-IDF), model training using logistic regression.
